# remove-numbers-out-of-midrange

The algorithm selects the numbers closest to the arithmetic mean.

This project was created to be able to select the numbers that are closest to the mean of a series of numbers.

It was useful to me because I was looking for a way to discard amounts of minutes that were far from the average. I needed to know what the normal duration of a bus trip was in an Android application, where the driver would press a button to start the trip, and press it again to finish the trip, and the application would save the durations in minutes, but I needed that if for some reason he finished his work day and forgot to press the end of trip button, that duration would be discarded. and with this little algorithm I manage to discard the numbers that are out of the "normal" and thus only save the durations that could be chosen by the bus driver, discarding forgetfulness.

To test this app in your android studio you just have to press "get from VCS" in the welcome screen of android studio and paste the github address of this repository, or download it and open it with the "open" button of the same android studio on its welcome screen, browsing the directories or folders until selecting the folder of this project on your computer.

This project is written in Java, so for help I advise you to go to the official oracle page:
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/18/docs/api/index.html
and for help with android studio the official page:

This little project arose by chance, and I hope it can help someone to practice the java language and practice managing the fabulous android studio. My name is Marcos Garc√≠a and I have created this project for myself and the community
